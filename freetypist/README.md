# freetypist

Provides FreeType font loading for TextraTypist.

This depends on FreeType, so you must have the appropriate platform dependencies for that, if you don't already.

# Dependency

I'm working on it.

You could also just copy the two source files,
[FreeTypistSkin.java](src/main/java/com/github/tommyettinger/freetypist/FreeTypistSkin.java)
and
[FreeTypistSkinLoader.java](src/main/java/com/github/tommyettinger/freetypist/FreeTypistSkinLoader.java),
into your own project, which is probably the easiest route. This is what TextraTypist does for its tests.
