<h2>A Starry</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SZexcEs.png" alt="A Starry"/>
<br>
(uses width=8, height=8)
<br>
A very large fixed-width Font already configured to use a square font with 45-degree angled sections,
based on the typeface used on the Atari ST console. This font only supports ASCII, but it supports all of it.
Caches the result for later calls. The font is "a-starry", based on "Atari ST (low-res)" by Damien Guard; it is
available under a CC-BY-SA-3.0 license, which requires attribution to Damien Guard (and technically Tommy
Ettinger, because he made changes in a-starry) if you use it.

<h2>A Starry Tall</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/atLseLB.png" alt="A Starry Tall"/>
<br>
(uses width=8, height=16)
<br>
The above A Starry also looks good if you scale it so its height is twice its width. For small sizes, you should stick to
multiples of 8. This "A Starry Tall" version is present in getAll() and getAllStandard(). This font only supports ASCII,
but it supports all of it. Caches the result for later calls. The font is "a-starry", based on "Atari ST (low-res)" by
Damien Guard; it is available under a CC-BY-SA-3.0 license, which requires attribution to Damien Guard (and technically Tommy
Ettinger, because he made changes in a-starry) if you use it.

<h2>A Starry using MSDF</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bpsA6Ci.png" alt="A Starry using MSDF"/>
<br>
(uses width=10, height=10, crispness 2.5)
<br>
A Font already configured to use a square font with 45-degree angled sections, based on the
typeface used on the Atari ST console, that should scale cleanly to many sizes. This font only supports ASCII,
but it supports all of it. Caches the result for later calls. The font is "a-starry", based on "Atari ST
(low-res)" by Damien Guard; it is available under a CC-BY-SA-3.0 license, which requires attribution to Damien
Guard (and technically Tommy Ettinger, because he made changes in a-starry) if you use it. This uses the
Multi-channel Signed Distance Field (MSDF) technique as opposed to the normal Signed Distance Field technique,
which gives the rendered font sharper edges and precise corners instead of rounded tips on strokes.
<br>
If you only need sizes in small integer multiples of 8 pixels, you might get sharper-looking results from
getAStarry().

<h2>Bitter</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cd1NyFQ.png" alt="Bitter"/>
<br>
(uses width=33, height=30)
<br>
A Font already configured to use a light-weight variable-width slab serif font with good Latin and
Cyrillic script support, that should scale pretty well from a height of about 160 down to a height of maybe 30.
Caches the result for later calls. The font used is Bitter, a free (OFL) typeface by <a href="https://github.com/solmatas/BitterPro">The Bitter Project</a>.
It supports quite a lot of Latin-based scripts and Cyrillic, but does not really cover Greek or any other
scripts. This font can look good at its natural size, which uses width roughly equal to height,
or squashed so height is slightly smaller. Bitter looks very similar to Gentium, except that Bitter
is quite a bit lighter, with thinner strokes and stylistic flourishes on some glyphs.
This uses a very-large standard bitmap font, which lets it be scaled down nicely but not scaled up very well.
This may work well in a font family with other fonts that do not use a distance field effect. Unlike most other
fonts here, this does not use makeGridGlyphs, because it would make underline and strikethrough much thicker than
other strokes in the font. This does mean that strikethrough starts too far to the left, and extends too far to
the right, unfortunately, but its weight matches.

<h2>Canada1500</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PjSpTwP.png" alt="Canada1500"/>
<br>
(uses width=30, height=35)
<br>
A Font already configured to use a very-legible variable-width font with strong support for Canadian
Aboriginal Syllabic, that should scale pretty well from a height of about 86 down to a height of maybe 30.
Caches the result for later calls. The font used is Canada1500, a free (public domain, via CC0) typeface by Ray
Larabie. It supports quite a lot of Latin-based scripts, Greek, Cyrillic, Canadian Aboriginal Syllabic, arrows,
many dingbats, and more. This font can look good at its natural size, which uses width roughly equal to height,
or narrowed down so width is smaller.
This uses a very-large standard bitmap font, which lets it be scaled down nicely but not scaled up very well.
This may work well in a font family with other fonts that do not use a distance field effect.

<h2>Cascadia Code Mono</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/i5DttKW.png" alt="Cascadia Code Mono"/>
<br>
(uses width=10, height=20)
<br>
A Font already configured to use a quirky fixed-width font with good Unicode support
and a humanist style, that should scale well from a height of about 60 pixels to about 15 pixels.
Caches the result for later calls. The font used is Cascadia Code Mono, an open-source (SIL Open Font
License) typeface by Microsoft (see <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code">Microsoft's page</a>).
It supports a lot of glyphs, including most extended Latin, Greek, Braille, and Cyrillic.
This uses a fairly-large standard bitmap font, which lets it be scaled down nicely but not scaled up very well.
This may work well in a font family with other fonts that do not use a distance field effect.

(uses width=10, height=20)
<br>
A Font already configured to use a quirky fixed-width font with good Unicode support
and a humanist style, that should scale cleanly to even very large sizes (using an MSDF technique).
Caches the result for later calls. The font used is Cascadia Code Mono, an open-source (SIL Open Font

<h2>Caveat</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mW5jdNo.png" alt="Caveat"/>
<br>
(uses width=32, height=32)
<br>
A Font already configured to use a variable-width handwriting font with support for extended Latin and
Cyrillic, that should scale pretty well from a height of about 160 down to a height of maybe 20. It will look
sharper and more aliased at smaller sizes, but should be relatively smooth at a height of 32 or so. This is a
sort of natural handwriting, as opposed to the formal script in Tangerine.
Caches the result for later calls. The font used is Caveat, a free (OFL) typeface designed by Pablo Impallari.
This uses a very-large standard bitmap font, which lets it be scaled down nicely but not scaled up very well.
This may work well in a font family with other fonts that do not use a distance field effect.

<h2>Cozette</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GcNJT6O.png" alt="Cozette"/>
<br>
(uses width=7, height=13, useIntegerPositions(true); this size is small enough to make the scaled text unreadable in some places)
<br>
A Font configured to use a cozy fixed-width bitmap font,
<a href="https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette">Cozette by slavfox</a>. Cozette has broad coverage of Unicode,
including Greek, Cyrillic, Braille, and tech-related icons. This does not scale well except to integer
multiples, but it should look very crisp at its default size of 7x13 pixels. This defaults to having
Font.integerPosition set to true, which helps keep it pixel-perfect if 1 world unit is 1 pixel, but can
cause major visual issues if 1 world unit corresponds to much more than 1 pixel.
This may work well in a font family with other fonts that do not use a distance field effect.

<h2>DejaVu Sans Mono using MSDF</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JzXC2XQ.png" alt="DejaVu Sans Mono using MSDF"/>
<br>
(uses width=9, height=20)
<br>
A nice old standby font with very broad language support, DejaVu Sans Mono is fixed-width and can be clearly
readable but doesn't do anything unusual stylistically. It really does handle a lot of glyphs; not only does this
have practically all Latin glyphs in Unicode (enough to support everything from Icelandic to Vietnamese), it has
Greek (including Extended), Cyrillic (including some optional glyphs), IPA, Armenian (maybe the only font here to
do so), Georgian (which won't be treated correctly by some case-insensitive code, so it should only be used if
case doesn't matter), and Lao. It has full box drawing and Braille support, handles a wide variety of math
symbols, technical marks, and dingbats, etc. This uses the Multi-channel Signed Distance
Field (MSDF) technique as opposed to the normal Signed Distance Field technique, which gives the rendered font
sharper edges and precise corners instead of rounded tips on strokes.

<h2>Gentium</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/H6fTCd9.png" alt="Gentium"/>
<br>
(uses width=31, height=35)
<br>
A Font already configured to use a variable-width serif font with excellent Unicode support, that should
scale well from a height of about 132 down to a height of 34. Caches the result for later calls. The font used is
Gentium, an open-source (SIL Open Font License) typeface by SIL (see
<a href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/">SIL's page on Gentium here</a>). It supports a lot of glyphs,
including quite a bit of extended Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic, as well as some less-common glyphs from various
real languages. This does not use a distance field effect, as opposed to Gentium SDF. You may want
to stick using just fonts that avoid distance fields if you have a family of fonts.

<br>
(uses width=50, height=45, crispness=3, adjustLineHeight(0.625f))
<br>
A Font already configured to use a variable-width serif font with excellent Unicode support, that should
scale cleanly to even very large sizes (using an MSDF technique). You usually will want to reduce the line height
of this Font after you scale it; using <pre>KnownFonts.getGentium().scaleTo(55, 45).adjustLineHeight(0.8f)</pre>
usually works. Caches the result for later calls. The font used is Gentium, an open-source (SIL Open Font
License) typeface by SIL (see <a href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/">SIL's page on Gentium here</a>). It
supports a lot of glyphs, including quite a

<h2>Hanazono</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3MfINWq.png" alt="Hanazono"/>
<br>
(uses width=16, height=20)
<br>
A Font already configured to use a variable-width, narrow font with nearly-complete CJK character
coverage, plus Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic, that shouldm scale pretty well down, but not up.
Caches the result for later calls. The font used is Hanazono (HanMinA, specifically), a free (OFL) typeface.
This uses a somewhat-small standard bitmap font because of how many glyphs are present (over 34000); it might not
scale as well as other standard bitmap fonts here.
This may work well in a font family with other fonts that do not use a distance field effect.

<h2>IBM 8x16</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ld8UAO7.png" alt="IBM 8x16"/>
<br>
(uses width=8, height=16)
<br>
A Font configured to use a classic, nostalgic fixed-width bitmap font,
IBM 8x16 from the early, oft-beloved computer line. This font is notably loaded
from a SadConsole format file, which shouldn't affect how it looks (but in reality,
it might). This does not scale except to integer multiples, but it should look very
crisp at its default size of 8x16 pixels. This supports some extra characters, but
not at the typical Unicode codepoints.
This may work well in a font family with other fonts that do not use a distance field effect.
<br>
This does not include a license because the source, <a href="https://github.com/Thraka/SadConsole/tree/master/Fonts">SadConsole's fonts</a>,
did not include one. It is doubtful that IBM would have any issues with respectful use
of their signature font throughout the 1980s, but if the legality is concerning, you
can use Cozette or QuanPixel for a different bitmap font. There
is also A Starry for a non-pixel font styled after a font from the same era.

(uses .scaleTo(10, 24).fitCell(10, 24, false))
<br>
A Font already configured to use a highly-legible fixed-width font with good Unicode support
and a sans-serif geometric style. Does not use a distance field effect, and is sized best at 9x25 pixels.
Caches the result for later calls. The font used is Iosevka, an open-source (SIL Open Font License) typeface by
<a href="https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/">Belleve Invis</a>, and it uses several customizations
thanks to Iosevka's special build process. It supports a lot of glyphs, including quite a bit of extended Latin,
Greek, and Cyrillic.
This Font is already configured with Font.fitCell(float, float, boolean), and repeated calls to fitCell()
have an unknown effect; you may want to stick to scaling this and not re-fitting if you encounter issues.

(uses .setCrispness(0.75f).scaleTo(12, 26).fitCell(10, 25, false))
<br>
A Font already configured to use a highly-legible fixed-width font with good Unicode support
and a sans-serif geometric style, that should scale cleanly to even very large sizes (using an MSDF technique).
Caches the result for later calls. The font used is Iosevka, an open-source (SIL Open Font License) typeface by
<a href="https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/">Belleve Invis</a>, and it uses several customizations
thanks to Iosevka's special build process. It supports a lot of glyphs, including quite a bit of extended Latin,
Greek, and Cyrillic.
This Font is already configured with Font.fitCell(float, float, boolean), and repeated calls to fitCell()
have an unknown effect; you may want to stick to scaling this and not re-fitting if you encounter issues.
This uses the Multi-channel Signed Distance Field (MSDF) technique as opposed to the normal Signed Distance Field
technique, which gives the rendered font sharper edges and precise corners instead of rounded tips on strokes.
However, using a distance field makes it effectively impossible to mix fonts using a FontFamily (any variation in
distance field settings would make some fonts in the family blurry and others too sharp).

A Font already configured to use a variable-width serif font with good Unicode support, that should

Caches the result for later calls. The font used is Libertinus Serif, an open-source (SIL Open Font

This uses a very-large standard bitmap font, which lets it be scaled down nicely but not scaled up very well.
This may work well in a font family with other fonts that do not use a distance field effect. Earlier versions of
this font used an MSDF effect, but that doesn't work well with kerning, so the spacing between letters was odd,
and in general the font just didn't look as good as the similar Gentium SDF or even Gentium. The MSDF files are still

<br>
A Font configured to use a small variable-width bitmap font with extensive coverage of Asian scripts,
<a href="https://diaowinner.itch.io/galmuri-extended">QuanPixel</a>. QuanPixel has good coverage of Unicode,
including all of Greek, at least most of Cyrillic, a good amount of extended Latin, all of Katakana and Hiragana,
many Hangul syllables, and literally thousands of CJK ideograms. This does not scale well except to integer
multiples, but it should look very crisp at its default size of about 8 pixels tall with variable width. This
defaults to having Font.integerPosition set to true, which helps keep it pixel-perfect if 1 world unit is
1 pixel, but can cause major visual issues if 1 world unit corresponds to much more than 1 pixel.

Caches the result for later calls. The font used is Roboto Condensed, a free (Apache 2.0) typeface by Christian
Robertson. It supports Latin-based scripts almost entirely, plus Greek, (extended) Cyrillic, and more.
This font is meant to be condensed in its natural appearance, but can be scaled to be wider if desired.

You can add emoji to a font as inline images with KnownFonts.addEmoji(Font).
Emoji don't work at all with MSDF fonts, and don't support more than one color with SDF fonts, but work as intended
with "standard" fonts (without a distance field effect). They can scale reasonably well down, and less-reasonably well
up, but at typical text sizes (12-30 pixels in height) they tend to be legible. There are over 3000 emoji in the Twemoji
set, and they are accessible both by name, using the syntax <code>[+clown face]</code>, and by entering the actual
emoji, using the syntax <code>[+🤡]</code>. You can search for names in Twemoji.atlas, or use the emoji picker in
<a href="https://github.com/raeleus/skin-composer">Skin Composer</a> to navigate by category. You can also use the
emoji picker present in some OSes, such as how Win+. allows selecting an emoji on Windows 10 and up.
