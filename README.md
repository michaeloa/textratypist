# TextraTypist
![Animated preview](images/logo_animated.gif)

A text-display library centered around a label that prints over time, with both effects and styles.

In other words, this brings more features to text rendering in libGDX.

What does this look like? A little something like this...

## It's got labels!

There's a "normal" label here in the form of TextraLabel, which acts almost exactly like Label in scene2d.ui, but
allows the styles covered below. A lot of usage may prefer TypingLabel, though!

TypingLabel is a fairly normal scene2d.ui widget, and extends TextraLabel. However, it puts letters up on
the screen one at a time, unless it is told to skip ahead. This is a nostalgic effect found in many older text-heavy
games, and it looks like a typewriter is putting up each letter at some slower-than-instantaneous rate.

## It's got effects!

Yes, it has more than the typewriter mode! Text can hang above and then drop into place. It can jump up and down in a
long wave. It can waver and shudder, as if it is sick. It can blink in different colors, move in a gradient smoothly
between two colors, or go across a whole rainbow. Lots of options; lots of fun. Effects are almost the same as in
typing-label, but there have been some changes. You can check [the TextraTypist wiki](https://github.com/tommyettinger/textratypist/wiki/Examples)
for more information.

As of 0.6.1, there are many new effects. Jolt, Spiral, Spin, Crowd, Shrink, Emerge, Heartbeat, Carousel, Squash, Scale,
and Rotate are all new to TextraTypist (not in typing-label). You can see usage instructions and sample GIFs at
[the TextraTypist wiki's Tokens page](https://github.com/tommyettinger/textratypist/wiki/Tokens). Most of these effects
make use of the smooth scaling and rotation options that effects can use starting in TextraTypist 0.5.1 .

## And now, it's got style!

This library extends what the original typing-label can do -- it allows styles to be applied to text, such as bold,
underline, oblique, superscript, etc. Related to styles are scale changes, which can shrink or enlarge text without
changing your font, and the "font family" feature. A font can be assigned a "family" of other fonts and names to use to
refer to them; this acts like a normal style, but actually changes what Font is used to draw. The full list of styles is
long, but isn't as detailed as the effect tokens. You can enable styles with something like libGDX color markup, in
square brackets like `[*]`, or you can use `{STYLE=BOLD}` to do the same thing. The full list of styles:

- `[*]` toggles bold mode. Can use style names `*`, `B`, `BOLD`, `STRONG`.
- `[/]` toggles oblique mode (like italics). Can use style names `/`, `I`, `OBLIQUE`, `ITALIC`.
- `[^]` toggles superscript mode (and turns off subscript or midscript mode). Can use style names `^`, `SUPER`, `SUPERSCRIPT`.
- `[=]` toggles midscript mode (and turns off superscript or subscript mode). Can use style names `=`, `MID`, `MIDSCRIPT`.
- `[.]` toggles subscript mode (and turns off superscript or midscript mode). Can use style names `.`, `SUB`, `SUBSCRIPT`.
- `[_]` toggles underline mode. Can use style names `_`, `U`, `UNDER`, `UNDERLINE`.
- `[~]` toggles strikethrough mode. Can use style names `~`, `STRIKE`, `STRIKETHROUGH`.
- `[!]` toggles all upper case mode (replacing any other case mode). Can use style names `!`, `UP`, `UPPER`.
- `[,]` toggles all lower case mode (replacing any other case mode). Can use style names `,`, `LOW`, `LOWER`.
- `[;]` toggles capitalize each word mode (replacing any other case mode). Can use style names `;`, `EACH`, `TITLE`.
- `[%DDD]`, where DDD is a percentage from 0 to 375, scales text to that multiple. Can be used with `{SIZE=150%}`, `{SIZE=%25}`, or similarly `{STYLE=200%}`.
- `[%]` on its own sets text to the default 100% scale.
- `[@Name]`, where Name is a key/name in this Font's `family` variable, switches the current typeface to the named one.
- `[@]` on its own resets the typeface to this Font, ignoring its family.
- `[#HHHHHHHH]`, where HHHHHHHH is a hex RGB888 or RGBA8888 int color, changes the color. This is a normal `{COLOR=#HHHHHHHH}` tag.
- `[COLORNAME]`, where COLORNAME is a typically-upper-case color name that will be looked up externally, changes the color.
  - By default, this looks up COLORNAME in libGDX's `Colors` class, but it can be configured to create colors differently.
    - You can use `Font`'s `setColorLookup()` method with your own `ColorLookup` implementation to do what you want here.
    - `TypingLabel` does still try to look up color names in `Colors`, but will fall back to using whatever `ColorLookup`
       a `Font` uses. You can clear the known names with `Colors.getColors().clear()`, which will force a `ColorLookup` to be used.
  - The name can optionally be preceded by `|`, which allows looking up colors with names that contain punctuation.
    For example, `[|;_;]` would look up a color called `;_;`, "the color of sadness," and would not act like `[;]`.
  - This also can be used with a color tag, such as `{COLOR=SKY}` (which Colors can handle right away) or
    `{COLOR=Lighter Orange-Red}` (which would need that color to be defined).
    - One way colors such as `Lighter Orange-Red` can be defined is done in [SquidSquad](https://github.com/yellowstonegames/SquidSquad),
      which defines its own `ColorLookup`.
- `[+region name]`, where region name is the name of a TextureRegion from a registered TextureAtlas, won't change the 
  style, but will produce that TextureRegion in-line with the text.
  - This is commonly used with `KnownFonts.addEmoji()` to add the 3000+ Twemoji icons to a Font.
    - If you use Twemoji, the phrasees `[+saxophone]` and `[+üé∑]` will each show a saxophone icon.
    - This also works with multipart emoji, such as `[+call me hand, medium-dark skin tone]` and `[+ü§ôüèæ]`.

## But wait, there's fonts!

Textratypist makes heavy use of its new `Font` class, which is a full overhaul of libGDX's BitmapFont that shares
essentially no code with its ancestor. A Font has various qualities that give it more power than BitmapFont, mostly
derived from how it stores (and makes available) the glyph images as TextureRegions in a map. There's nothing strictly
preventing you from adding your own images to the `mapping` of a Font, as long as they have the requisite information to
be used as a textual glyph, and then placing those images in with your text. Textratypist supports standard bitmap
fonts and also distance field fonts, using SDF or MSDF. `TypingLabel` will automatically enable the ShaderProgram that
the appropriate distance field type needs (if it needs one) and disable it after rendering itself. You can change this
behavior by manually calling the `Font.enableShader(Batch)` method on your Font, and changing the Batch back to your
other ShaderProgram of choice with its `Batch.setShader()` method (often, you just pass null here to reset the shader).

There are several preconfigured font settings in `KnownFonts`; the documentation for each font getter says what files
are needed to use that font. This is meant to save some hassle getting the xAdjust, yAdjust, widthAdjust, 
and heightAdjust parameters just right, though you're still free to change them however you wish. The variety of font
types isn't amazing, but it should be a good starting point. One nice new thing to note is the
`KnownFonts.getStandardFamily()` method, which requires having 13 fonts in your assets, but naturally lets you switch
between any of those 13 fonts using the `[@Medieval]` syntax (where Medieval is one of the names it knows, in this case
for "KingThings Foundation"). All of these fonts work without a distance field effect, so they won't look as good at
very large sizes, but are compatible with each other.

The Twemoji icons are also present in an atlas of over-3000 32x32 images; `KnownFonts.addEmoji()` can register them with
a Font so the `[+name]` syntax mentioned above can draw emoji inline.

The license files for each font are included in the same folder, in `knownFonts` here. All fonts provided here were
checked to ensure their licenses permit commercial use without fees, and all do. Most require attribution; check the
licenses for details.

## Act now and get these features, free of charge!

You can rotate individual glyphs (if you draw them individually) or rotate whole blocks of text as a Layout, using an
optional overload of `Font.drawGlyph()` or `Font.drawGlyphs()`. Custom effects for `TypingLabel` can also individually
change the rotation of any glyph, as well as its position and scale on x and/or y. You can rotate a TextraLabel or
TypingLabel by using their `setRotation()` methods, and the rotation will now act correctly for labels with backgrounds
and/or with different alignment settings. The origin for rotations can be set in the label, and the whole label will
rotate around that origin point. You can also, for some fonts, have
box-drawing characters and block elements be automatically generated. This needs a solid white block character (of any
size, typically 1x1) present in the font at id 0 (used here because most fonts don't use it) or better, 9608 (the
Unicode full block index, `'\u2588'`, which is preferred because BitmapFont treats id 0 differently). This also enables
a better guarantee of underline and strikethrough characters connecting properly, and without smudging where two
underscores or hyphens overlap each other. `Font` attempts to enable this in some cases, or it can be set with a
parameter, but if it fails then it falls back to using underscores for underline and hyphens for strikethrough. All the
fonts in `KnownFonts` either are configured to use a solid block or to specifically avoid it because that font renders
better without it. Note that if you create a `Font` from a libGDX `BitmapFont`, this defaults to not even trying to make
grid glyphs, because BitmapFonts rarely have a suitable solid block char.

These two features are new in 0.3.0, and are expected to see more attention in future releases.

## Hold the phone, there's widgets!

Starting in the 0.4.0 release, there are various widgets that replace their
scene2d.ui counterparts and swap out `Label` for `TextraLabel`, allowing you to use markup in them.
The widgets are `ImageTextraButton`, `TextraButton`, `TextraCheckBox`, `TextraDialog`, `TextraLabel`, `TextraTooltip`, 
and `TextraWindow`, at least, so far.

Future additions to these widgets should permit setting the `TextraLabel` to a `TypingLabel` of your choice.
While `TextArea` is not yet supported, `TextraLabel` defaults to supporting multiple lines, and may be able to stand-in
for some usage. A counterpart to `TextArea` is planned.

## How do I get it?

You probably want to get this with Gradle! The dependency for a libGDX project's core module looks like:

```groovy
implementation "com.github.tommyettinger:textratypist:0.6.1"
```

This assumes you already depend on libGDX; TextraTypist depends on version 1.11.0 or higher. The requirement for 1.11.0
was added in TextraTypist 0.5.0 because of some breaking changes in tooltip code in libGDX.

If you use GWT, this should be compatible. It needs these dependencies in the html module:

```groovy
implementation "com.github.tommyettinger:textratypist:0.6.1:sources"
implementation "com.github.tommyettinger:regexodus:0.1.13:sources"
```

GWT also needs this in the GdxDefinition.gwt.xml file:
```xml
<inherits name="regexodus" />
<inherits name="textratypist" />
```

RegExodus is the GWT-compatible regular-expression library this uses to match some complex patterns internally. Other
than libGDX itself, RegExodus is the only dependency this project has.

There is at least one release in the [Releases](https://github.com/tommyettinger/textratypist/releases) section of this
repo, but you're still encouraged to use Gradle to handle this library and its dependencies.

## License

This is based very closely on [typing-label](https://github.com/rafaskb/typing-label), by Rafa Skoberg.
Typing-label is MIT-licensed according to its repo `LICENSE` file, but (almost certainly unintentionally) does not
include any license headers in any files. Since the only requirement of the MIT license is to leave any license text
as-is, this Apache-licensed project is fully compliant with MIT. The full MIT license text is in the file
`typing-label.LICENSE`, and the Apache 2 license for this project is in the file `LICENSE`. Apache license headers are
also present in all library source files here. The Apache license does not typically apply to non-code resources in the
`src/test/resources` folder; individual fonts have their own licenses stored in that directory.

Twemoji isn't a font, so it might be best to mention it separately. It's licensed under CC-BY 4.0, and requires
attribution to Twitter if used.

The logo was made by Raymond "raeleus" Buckley and contributed to this project. It can be used freely for any purpose,
but I request that it only be used to refer to this project unless substantially modified.

## Thanks

Wow, raeleus has really helped a tremendous amount. Both by testing TextraTypist in his Skin Composer app (which found
quite a lot of bugs, small and large), and advising on proper scene2d.ui layout practices (which were not easy to get
100% right), the large 0.5.2 release (and those after it) would not be what it is today without his input. Thank you!

Thanks to fraudo for helping me go step-by-step to figure out how badly I had screwed up rotation with backgrounds, and
for writing most of `LabelRotationTest`. Release 0.5.5 would still probably be in development for months without that
help, so thanks are in order.

Of course, I have to thank Rafa Skoberg for writing quite a lot of the code here! About 2/3 of the effects are almost
purely by Rafa, much of the TypingLabel-related code is nearly unchanged from his work, and in general he showed what
libGDX UIs could be just by making the initial code.

Thanks to all the font designers who made fonts we use here; by making your fonts freely available, you perform a great
service to the people who depend on them.
